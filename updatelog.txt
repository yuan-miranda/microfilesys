v.0.3.5 12/10/2023
    - Modified some of the function descriptions.

    fixed issues:
        - Removed the writing restriction where 'write --line 1 "print("hello")"' is invalid, now you can write
        any content as long as it is enclosed with a pair of single or double quotation marks.
        - 'write --line 10 ""' is fixed now, it doesnt write a content but makes a newline up to the specified line.

    known issues:
        - 'read --all' is currently slow when printing large files I think.


v.0.3.4 12/08/2023
    - Added version and last update info.
    - Added updatelog.txt that contains all the update info's.
    - Added 'ls' command that list all the files in the current working directory.
    - Added 'remove <-l line=int | -a>' command that removes the desired line from the file.
    - Modified the help page and removed some unnecessary parts of it.
    - Command 'read' now has a prefix line number when printing lines.
    - Command 'read, clear, remove' are almost identical so they are replaced on process_common_command().
    - Made the 'current_open_file' to global to remove the annoying 'file_name' on every functions that needs it.

    fixed issues:
        - 'read --all' now doesnt print the newline buffer at the end of the file.

    known issues:
        - 'write --line 10 ""' ironically does nothing currently at all lol.
        - 'read --all' is currently slow when printing large files I think.
